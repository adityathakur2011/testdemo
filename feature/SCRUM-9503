Below is a complete Python code snippet that uses Flask to create a simple web application with a session management system. Upon user logout, the session is securely terminated, and any session-related data on the client-side is cleared. This solution ensures the fulfillment of the acceptance criteria and use cases.

```python
from flask import Flask, session, redirect, url_for, request, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

# It is important to set a secret key for the session
app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'  # Replace with your own secret key for production

@app.route('/')
def home():
    # Checking if the user is logged in by verifying session data
    if 'username' in session:
        return f'Logged in as {session["username"]}<br>' \
               f'<a href="{url_for("logout")}">Click here to log out</a>'
    return 'You are not logged in.<br>' \
           f'<a href="{url_for("login")}">Click here to log in</a>'

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Simulate user login with hardcoded username
        session['username'] = request.form['username']
        return redirect(url_for('home'))
    return '''
        <form method="post">
            Username: <input type="text" name="username"><br>
            <input type="submit" value="Log In">
        </form>
    '''

@app.route('/logout')
def logout():
    # Ensures the session is terminated by clearing session data
    session.pop('username', None)
    # Optional: Invalidate server-side session data if stored outside session
    session.clear()  # Clears all keys in the current session

    # Redirect to home after logout
    return redirect(url_for('home'))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Key Points:
- **Session Management**: The application uses Flask's session mechanism to handle session data. The session is backed by a signed cookie.
- **Ending a Session**: The `logout` function securely ends the session by removing the 'username' from the session and calls `session.clear()` to ensure no residual session data is present.
- **Security Consideration**: The `app.secret_key` must be changed to a secure, random value in a real-world application to safeguard the session integrity.
- **Logout Redirection**: After logging out, the user is redirected to the home page, and only a "You are not logged in" message should display to confirm the logout.

This implementation meets the acceptance criteria by securely invalidating the session token and clearing session data on the client-side when the user logs out.
