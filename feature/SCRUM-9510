Below is a complete Python code snippet that optimizes the login process for speed. It leverages appropriate data structures and implements best practices for efficient user validation, ensuring a fast login experience. I assume we have a user database (represented here as a dictionary for simplicity), and we implement basic login functionality with comments explaining each step:

```python
import bcrypt

class UserDatabase:
    def __init__(self):
        # Example user database with username as key and hashed password as value
        self.users = {
            "john_doe": bcrypt.hashpw("secure_password".encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt()),
            # Add more users as required
        }

    def validate_user(self, username, password):
        """Validate user credentials."""
        if username in self.users:
            # Hash the input password and compare with stored hash for validation
            return bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode('utf-8'), self.users[username])
        return False

class LoginSystem:
    def __init__(self, user_db):
        self.user_db = user_db

    def login(self, username, password):
        """Attempt to log in a user."""
        if self.user_db.validate_user(username, password):
            print("Login successful!")
        else:
            print("Invalid username or password.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize with the example user database
    user_db = UserDatabase()
    login_system = LoginSystem(user_db)

    # Example login attempts
    login_system.login("john_doe", "secure_password")  # Expected to be successful
    login_system.login("john_doe", "wrong_password")   # Expected to fail
```

Explanation:
- We use `bcrypt` for hashing passwords to ensure security while maintaining speed. `bcrypt` hashes and verifies are designed to be computationally efficient.
- The `UserDatabase` class mimics a user database where usernames are keys and their passwords are securely stored in hashed form.
- The `validate_user` method in `UserDatabase` handles password verification.
- `LoginSystem` provides a simple login interface to interact with the user database.
- Password validation is achieved using `bcrypt.checkpw`, which efficiently handles password hashing and comparison.
- It demonstrates overall good practices for managing passwords and login verifications quickly and securely.
